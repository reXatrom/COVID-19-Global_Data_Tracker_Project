# 📝 Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description

In this project, learners will build a data analysis and reporting notebook (or app) that tracks global COVID-19 trends. The project will analyze **cases**, **deaths**, **recoveries, and vaccinations** across countries and time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.

By the end, they’ll have a **data analysis report with visuals and narrative insights**, suitable for presentation or publishing.

### 🚩 Project Objectives:

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

### 🗂️ Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)

**1️⃣ Data Collection**

* Goal: Obtain a reliable COVID-19 dataset.

***✅ Data Sources:***

* Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset (CSV & API)

* Johns Hopkins University GitHub Repository

👉 Recommended for beginners: Use the cleaned CSV from Our World in Data (easy to load with pandas).

***✅ Action:***

* Download owid-covid-data.csv from the above link.

* Save in your working folder.

---

**2️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration**

* Goal: Load the dataset and explore its structure.

***✅ Tasks:***

* Load data using ***pandas.read_csv()***.

* Check columns: ***df.columns***.

* Preview rows: ***df.head()***.

* Identify missing values: ***df.isnull().sum()***.

***✅ Tools:***

* ***pandas***

***📌 Key columns:***

* **date, location, total_cases, total_deaths, new_cases, new_deaths, total_vaccinations,** etc.

---

**3️⃣ Data Cleaning**

* Goal: Prepare data for analysis.

***✅ Tasks:***

* Filter countries of interest (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).

* Drop rows with missing dates/critical values.

* Convert ***date*** column to datetime: ***pd.to_datetime()***.

* Handle missing numeric values with ***fillna()*** or ***interpolate()***.

***✅ Tools:***

* ***pandas***

---

**4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Goal: Generate descriptive statistics & explore trends.

***✅ Tasks:***

* Plot total cases over time for selected countries.

* Plot total deaths over time.

* Compare daily new cases between countries.

* Calculate the death rate: ***total_deaths / total_cases***.

***✅ Visualizations:***

* Line charts (cases & deaths over time).

* Bar charts (top countries by total cases).

* Heatmaps (optional for correlation analysis).

***✅ Tools:***

* ***matplotlib***

* ***seaborn***

---

**5️⃣ Visualizing Vaccination Progress**

* Goal: Analyze vaccination rollouts.

***✅ Tasks:***

* Plot cumulative vaccinations over time for selected countries.

* Compare % vaccinated population.

***✅ Charts:***

* Line charts.

* Optional: Pie charts for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.

***✅ Tools:***

* ***matplotlib***

* ***seaborn***

---

**6️⃣ Optional: Build a Choropleth Map**

* Goal: Visualize cases or vaccination rates **by country on a world map**.

***✅ Tools:***

* Plotly Express

* Or geopandas (advanced)

***✅ Tasks:***

* Prepare a dataframe with ***iso_code***, ***total_cases*** for the latest date.

* Plot a choropleth showing case density or vaccination rates.

---

**7️⃣ Insights & Reporting**

* Goal: Summarize findings.

***✅ Tasks:***

* Write 3-5 key insights from the data (e.g., "X country had the fastest vaccine rollout").

* Highlight anomalies or interesting patterns.

* Use markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook to write your narrative.

***✅ Deliverables:***

* A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook** combining:

    * Code

    * Visualizations

    * Narrative explanations

* Optional export: **Notebook → PDF** or a PowerPoint with screenshots.

## 🧪 What to Build

Here’s what your code should include:

### Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset🏗️  

1. Choose a dataset in CSV format (for example, you can use datasets like the Iris dataset, a sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice).

2. Load the dataset using pandas.

3. Display the first few rows of the dataset using ***.head()*** to inspect the data.

4. Explore the structure of the dataset by checking the data types and any missing values.

5. Clean the dataset by either filling or dropping any missing values.



### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis🎭

1. Compute the basic statistics of the numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) using ***.describe()***.

2. Perform groupings on a categorical column (for example, species, region, or department) and compute the mean of a numerical column for each group.

3. Identify any patterns or interesting findings from your analysis.



### Task 3: Data Visualization

1. Create at least four different types of visualizations:

* **Line chart** showing trends over time (for example, a time-series of sales data).

* **Bar chart** showing the comparison of a numerical value across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).

* **Histogram** of a numerical column to understand its distribution.

* **Scatter plot** to visualize the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).

2. Customize your plots with titles, labels for axes, and legends where necessary.

## Additional instructions

**✅ 1. Upload your project to GitHub**

* Create a new public repository on GitHub

**✅ 2. Add a ***README.md*** file to your repository**
Your ***README.md*** should include:

* Project title and short description

* Objectives of the project

* List of tools and libraries used

* How to run/view the project

* Any insights or reflections


**✅ 3. Check that your notebook runs from start to finish**
Please ensure that your notebook runs **without errors** and displays all outputs.


**✅ 4. Share your GitHub repository link**
Once uploaded, submit your **GitHub repository link** via the class submission form (or send it to me directly if instructed).
